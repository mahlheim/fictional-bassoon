## Description
This application offers a way to generate a simple logo for projects. Inquirer is utilized to ask the user questions about the desired design of the logo. Once completed, a file called "logo.svg" will be created containing the new logo. Examples can be found in the example folder in the repo.

## Installation
Clone the repo. Ensure node.js is installed, then open the repo in a code editor. Open a terminal to the repo and then install the required dependencies: inquirer and jest. 

## Usage
Run "node index.js" in the CL. Answer the four questions as they appear. Then, several console logs will print that list the user's input as well as the code that is created that renders the logo. Finally, a success message will read "Generated logo.svg!".
