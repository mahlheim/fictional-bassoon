## Description
This application offers a way to generate a simple logo for projects. Inquirer is utilized to ask the user questions about the desired design of the logo. Once completed, a file called "logo.svg" will be created containing the new logo.

## Installation
Clone the repo and open with a code editor. Then open a terminal on the index.js file and run "node index.js" in the CL. Answer the questions as they appear. Then you will recieve a success message that reads "Check out your new logo in the "logo.svg" file!".
